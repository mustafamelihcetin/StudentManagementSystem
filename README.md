# Student Management System

## Overview

The Student Management System is a C# Windows Forms application designed to manage student data efficiently. The system consists of three main forms:

1. **FrmLogin.cs**: This form allows users to log in to the system. Upon entering a predefined password like "1111," the teacher detail form opens.

2. **FrmStudentDetail.cs**: This form enables users to view detailed information about students. When an student number is entered, the form displays the student's name, surname, exam grades, average, and status.

3. **FrmTeacherDetail.cs**: This form provides teachers with an overview of students' general status. It calculates and displays the total number of passing and failing students. Additionally, teachers can register new students and update existing student information.
